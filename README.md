# The-Emerald-Ruins
Explanation: This program works as a choose your own adventure game. 
While not being too complex, there are many branching paths determined by the user. 
The program recieves user input to determine what path to take, and calls upon various methods to output
the results or execute a calculation. 

This project was first made during Fall Quarter 2016 for the final project for CS 110. Originally written in Java, I remade the program in C++ to gain some experience before I was taught the language in future classes.
